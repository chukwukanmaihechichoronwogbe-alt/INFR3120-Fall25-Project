Book review site 
Our team has decided to create a Book Review Web Application as a part of our Project Part 1. With this application, one is able to browse books, read other user reviews and also post their reviews. This project is undertaken to exercise the construction of working web interfaces and application of fundamental CRUD operations that are representative of Web application architecture. The opening page will contain the title of our web site, a basic custom team logo, and a plain design, which will guide them to start using the site.


The program will enable users to make new book reviews by adding a book title, author, rating, and review. These reviews will be presented in a table or dashboard form in the landing page and the reviews that are already available will be easily seen. The site will also have full CRUD capability such that the user can not only create a review, he can see all the reviews, edit and/or remove the review all together. This initial release will use front-end JavaScript logic or browser local storage as the data store. The version is more functional than stylish; subsequent versions will enhance form and style. Compared to the class project and Assignment 03, the project is more specific in terms of its review of book reviews provided by users and communication with the reader.


In this first release, every group member is to make an equal contribution. To be credited, every member should write and save his/her code in GitHub with a personal account. The current release forms the basis of our Book Review Site as it illustrates the entry level site structure, operational screens, CRUD activities and deployment on a cloud platform. Subsequent releases will increase functionality, database integration and User interface.
